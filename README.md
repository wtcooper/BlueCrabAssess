Final ADMB model with accompanying R code (plots, MCMC) for 2012 Florida and Gulf of Mexico assessments. Note all files are dumped in the src folder together, easiest way to build ADMB with data files.

See the CMSA_Ext.tpl and accompanying *_Ext.dat files for some enhanced features as part of the assessment review.

Final GDAR report can be found here: http://www.gsmfc.org/publications/GSMFC%20Number%20215.pdf
