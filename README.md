# BlueCrabAssess
Final ADMB model with accompanying R code (plots, MCMC) for 2012 Florida and Gulf of Mexico assessments. Note all files are dumped in the src folder together, easiest way to build ADMB with data files.

The CMSA.tpl is the final model used in the both assessments.  See the CMSA_Ext.tpl and accompanying *_Ext.dat files for some enhanced features that were added as part of model exploration during the assessment review.
